# WaterFall
WaterFall is a implementation of Python PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine. This is honestly me just trying to make a operational web browser in python.

# NOTE:
Current Browser functionality
--> BackButton (going backwards to previous websites)
--> ForwardButton (going forward to previous websites)
--> ReloadButton (reload the current webpage)
--> HomeButton (Load the homepage)
--> AddressBar (Load url that is in the address bar)
--------> Select All when clicked into the address bar
--------> Pressing Enter will submit the url to be loaded
--> GoButton (Submit the text from addressBar to be loaded by browser)

Next Release:
[++] Researching Security aspects of PyQt5
Note: Is PyQT5 Secure with the base engine or do I need to add security? 

[++] Add AutoComplete to QLineEdit
Note: I want to add AutoComplete and History drop down. 

[++] Add setting button
Note: I want to add settings and have some general setting options defined

[++] Going to start working on a better user interface design
Note: I would like a more up-to-date user interface design with a higher quality in button options.

[++] I would like to later down the road get completly rid of the address bar section and create something that uses only voice commands. 
"hey [bla bla bla] navigate to google webpage ["https://www.googel.com"]j"
"hey [bla bla bla] open cookie settings [path to cookie settings]"
"hey [bla bla bla] turn on dark mode."

Researching: 
[???] Does PyQt5 have built in security?
[???] Saving Cache Data for AutoComplete.
[???] Best way to add History drop down to QLineEdit.
[???] Find a graphics designer who can make better quality user interface items than me.
[???] Can cortant interfact with my application in some way? 
IF NOT: [???] How to create my own built-in personal assistant (browser)
