--> Created a master font that can be used everywhere. 
--> Modified the toolbar to a set hight to look more sleek
--> set the master font to 12pt
--> set the new master font to all elements that were using Qfont
--> created a combobox 
Note: Instead of adding the QlineEdit (address bar) to the toolbar. Instead I have added it to the Combobox and added the Combobox to the Toolbar
--> set content length to 60. 
--> Created a completer (not working)
Note: I do want to get autocomplete working for the QlineEdit and QComboBox. (MORE reasearch is required)
